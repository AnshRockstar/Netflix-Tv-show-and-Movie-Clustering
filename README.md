# Netflix-Tv-show-and-Movie-Clustering
Performing the EDA, Understanding the content available and Is Netflix has increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.
I created a Dash web app that utlizes my model to provide film recommendations based on a user's favourite movie or TV show.

# NetflixRecommender System

FlixRecommender recommends Netflix movies and TV shows based on a user's favourite movie or TV show. It uses a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model and a K-Means Clustering model to make these recommendations. These models use information about movies and TV shows such as their plot descriptions and genres to make suggestions. The motivation behind this project is to develop a deeper understanding of recommender systems. Specifically, thinking about how companies like Netflix and YouTube create algorithms to tailor content based on user interests and behaviour.

## Data Source
For my project, I will collect a Netflix data set from [Almabetter](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19vS_L_SwOopA-pR6BECUENbRqczFRxl5):

1.	The data set presents information about movies and TV shows (*6234* in total) such as the title, director, cast, country, rating (ex. PG, PG-13, R, etc.), genre, and plot description. Please note only movies and TV shows available on Netflix as of 2019 were included in the data set.

## Dash Web App
I created a Dash web app that utlizes my model to provide film recommendations based on a user's favourite movie or TV show.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, tailored recommendations can be made based on information about movies and TV shows. In addition, similar models can be developed to provide valuable recommendations to consumers in other domains. For example, e-commerce companies, like Amazon, can use these types of algorithms to suggest similar products based on product descriptions and information.
